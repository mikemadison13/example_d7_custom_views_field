This module defines custom fields for use in Views (both with and without SOLR), the goal being to have a common set of code to call certain site features (e.g. title, description, etc.) that behave identically, and can be reused throughout the site on the node display, within all types of views, and in search results. 

See documentation in Confluence for additional information.
